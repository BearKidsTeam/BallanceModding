# Ballance Modding

Files for modding of a game named Ballance.

## What are these files?

They are files created with Virtools, containing logic scripts and data for Ballance. You can find them in your Ballance installation path. The files in this repository are the deobfuscated version of the corresponding files, created specifically for modders.

## What is the 'deobfuscated version' and why?

Virtools behaviors are programmed in a way called control flow graph, and can be edited with the schematic view in Virtools. However, the graph data of Ballance scripts is removed upon its release, making Virtools show 'script hidden' if we want to view or edit the script further.

However, with the logic data remaining inside Virtools files, it is possible to recover the graph data that is, maybe not consistant with the original view, yet readable and has the same function as the original graph data. The process is done using [this repo](https://github.com/BearKidsTeam/VirtoolsScriptDeobfuscation).

In this way, the scripts can now be easily read and modified if we want to create some mods of the game.

Here is a sample of the deobfuscated scripts. The graph of it is generated by algorithms.

## Why are some files missing in this repo?

Because those files contain no script. No need to deobfuscate them.

## What do I need to create mods for Ballance?

You will need Virtools Dev whose **version number is less or equal than 3.5 (3.5, 3.0, 2.5 or 2.1)**. Ballance is created by Virtools Dev 2.1. If the version is too high, Ballance might be unable to read your modified data.

## Bugs

The release is still not perfect, for these reasons:

* Some functions of 2D Sprites are broken because their inner data types are not recognized by newer version of Virtools;
* As a result, some visual elements in Ballance will be uglier if you replace the files by the deobfuscated ones;
* Some links in the graph are in a mess and you need to be patient to straighten them out.
